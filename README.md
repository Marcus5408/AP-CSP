# AP Comp Sci Principles Extended

## Description

This GitHub repo serves as a backup for all of the assignments I've done in my AP CSP class, just in case I someday lose the USB drive I've been using to store all of my work. Also can serve as proof of me doing work, I guess.

All of the files for any lesson are in their respective unit's folders:

```
/
└ U1/
  └ L1/
    └ U1L1-Example.ipynb
    └ main.py
```

I accidentally had my USB drive formatted as FAT32 initially, so git didn't work properly and I couldn't commit to this repo. That led to this repo on GitHub and the repo on my flash drive becoming out-of-sync with non-matching Git histories. It took me a good week of headaches to sort out, but hey, that's over now!

Anyway, I'll end the README here since I'm rambling at this point. If you're reading this, I hope you have a good day!
